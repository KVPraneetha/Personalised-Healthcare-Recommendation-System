\# 🏥 Personalised Healthcare Recommendation System



\## 📌 Project Summary

Developed a machine learning-based healthcare recommendation system that predicts potential diseases based on user-reported symptoms. The system leverages structured symptom datasets and classification algorithms to provide early-stage health insights.



This project demonstrates practical implementation of supervised learning, data preprocessing, and predictive modeling in the healthcare domain.
