\# 🏥 Personalised Healthcare Recommendation System



\## 📌 Project Summary

Developed a machine learning-based healthcare recommendation system that predicts potential diseases based on user-reported symptoms. The system leverages structured symptom datasets and classification algorithms to provide early-stage health insights.



This project demonstrates practical implementation of supervised learning, data preprocessing, and predictive modeling in the healthcare domain.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Early identification of diseases based on symptoms can help individuals seek timely medical attention. However, interpreting combinations of symptoms manually can be difficult and inconsistent.

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts possible diseases based on user-input symptoms using a structured dataset.

## 📈 Model Performance

- Algorithm Used: Random Forest
- Train-Test Split: 80:20
- Test Set Size: 24 samples
- Accuracy Achieved: 100%

The model achieved perfect accuracy on the test dataset. This is likely due to the structured and relatively small dataset, where symptom combinations strongly correlate with specific diseases.

Further improvements would involve testing on a larger and more diverse dataset to validate real-world generalization.

### Classification Report Summary

The model achieved:

- Precision: 1.00 across all classes
- Recall: 1.00 across all classes
- F1-score: 1.00 across all classes

This indicates perfect classification performance on the test dataset.
